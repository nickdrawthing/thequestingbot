# thequestingbot

This is a huge mess and needs some cleanup. HOWEVER: this is what I have so far. It is what it is.

TO DO:

Basically everything, honestly... but specifically:

- get file up/down working with either AWS or Drive

- get Stats and combat working

- get Quest construction working

TO DO WAY LATER:

- get community voting working
